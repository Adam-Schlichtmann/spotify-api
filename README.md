# Spotify Web API

## Motivation

Create a strongly typed wrapper to easily use the spotify api

## Type Definitions

All Types are taken from the spotify web api [reference](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/).

Disclaimer: I do NOT claim any of this to be correctly typed as of now. The first iterations will likely be covered in inconsistencies and errors. I am relying on using this in future projects to solidify the types as I can't be bothered to actually test it all right away.

## Road Map

As of now everything should be available (barring any mistakes I made)

### Future

- Support all Authorizations - Currently using Client Credentials
  - [Authorization code](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/code-flow/)
  - [Client Credentials](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/client-credentials/)
  - [Implicit Grant](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/implicit-grant/)
- Create better experience
- Testing
